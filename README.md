Using Java, created a program that when given an input file, message.txt, the string located in message.txt is encrypted using matrix multiplication. Once encrypted, the string is output to a new file, encrypted_message.txt, and again matrix multiplication is used to decrypt this file. A new file, decrypted_message.txt, is created, which contains the original string from message.txt after undergoing encryption and decryption.
